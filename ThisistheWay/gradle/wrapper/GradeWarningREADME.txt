Hello all, I just wanted to warn you on the few things in the instance we do edit a gradle file.


Avoid Direct Modifications: Instead of modifying Gradle files directly, prefer using Gradle's extension and plugin mechanisms to make changes. This ensures better maintainability and reduces the risk of introducing errors.

Dependency Versions: Be cautious when upgrading dependency versions. Always ensure that the upgraded version is compatible with your project's requirements and other dependencies. Test thoroughly after making such changes.

Dependency Conflicts: Watch out for dependency conflicts, especially when integrating multiple libraries or modules. Resolving these conflicts can be complex and may lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly.

Plugin Compatibility: Ensure that the plugins you're using are compatible with the Gradle version you're using. Incompatible plugins can cause build failures or other issues.

Build Script Logic: Keep build script logic simple and easy to understand. Complex logic can make builds harder to debug and maintain.

Avoid Hardcoding Values: Avoid hardcoding values such as file paths, URLs, or credentials directly into the build scripts. Instead, use Gradle properties or environment variables to provide configurable values.

Performance Considerations: Be mindful of performance implications when making changes to Gradle files. Large build scripts or inefficient configurations can significantly slow down build times.

Documentation and Comments: Document any significant changes made to Gradle files and use comments to explain complex logic or configurations. This helps other developers understand the purpose and behavior of the build scripts.

Testing: Test your changes thoroughly across different environments and scenarios to ensure they work as expected. Automated tests for the build process can help catch issues early.

Version Control: Use version control systems like Git to track changes to Gradle files. This makes it easier to revert changes if something goes wrong and facilitates collaboration among team members.
